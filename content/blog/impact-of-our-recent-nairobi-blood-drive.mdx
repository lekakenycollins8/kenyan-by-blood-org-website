# Impact of Our Recent Nairobi Blood Drive

Last weekend, Kenyan By Blood Foundation hosted one of our largest blood drives of the year at Uhuru Park in Nairobi. The event was a tremendous success, bringing together hundreds of donors from all walks of life and collecting over 200 units of blood that will help save up to 600 lives across Kenya.

## Community Participation

The turnout exceeded our expectations, with people queuing up even before the official 8 AM start time. By the end of the day at 5 PM, we had registered:

- 267 potential donors
- 215 successful donations
- 52 first-time donors
- Donors ranging from 18 to 65 years old

What made this drive particularly special was the diversity of participants. We saw university students, corporate professionals, government workers, and retirees all coming together for this important cause.

## Partner Support

This blood drive wouldn't have been possible without our dedicated partners:

- **Nairobi County Government** provided the venue and logistical support
- **Kenya National Blood Transfusion Service** supplied technical staff and equipment
- **Nairobi University Medical School** sent volunteer medical students to assist
- **Savanna Beverages** donated refreshments for all donors
- **Capital FM** provided media coverage and live broadcasts

## Personal Stories

Among the many donors, several stories stood out:

### James Mwangi's 50th Donation

James Mwangi, a 56-year-old teacher, made his 50th blood donation at our drive. "I started donating when my wife needed blood during childbirth 30 years ago," he told us. "Since then, I've donated regularly, knowing that my blood might save someone else's loved one."

### The Corporate Challenge

A friendly competition between three local companies brought in over 60 donors. Equity Bank emerged as the winner with 28 employees donating, followed closely by Safaricom with 22 donors and Kenya Airways with 14.

## Impact on Blood Supply

The 215 units collected will have a significant impact on Kenya's blood supply:

- Approximately 70 units will go to maternal health cases
- About 50 units will support cancer patients
- Around 40 units will be used for emergency trauma cases
- The remaining units will help patients with various medical conditions

Dr. Njeri Kamau from the Kenya National Blood Transfusion Service noted, "This single drive has replenished about 20% of our weekly needs for Nairobi County. It's a tremendous contribution to our healthcare system."

## Educational Outreach

Beyond collecting blood, the drive served as an educational platform. Our team:

- Conducted mini-workshops on blood donation facts
- Distributed educational materials in English and Swahili
- Registered 120 new potential donors in our database
- Addressed common misconceptions about blood donation

## Looking Forward

The success of this drive has encouraged us to expand our efforts. We're now planning:

1. Monthly drives in different Nairobi neighborhoods
2. Partnerships with more universities and colleges
3. A mobile donation unit to reach underserved areas
4. Enhanced donor recognition program

## Conclusion

The Nairobi blood drive demonstrated once again the generosity and community spirit of Kenyans. Every donor who rolled up their sleeve has contributed to saving lives across our country. As one donor put it, "It's the easiest way to be a hero."

We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who participated, volunteered, or supported this event. Together, we are making Kenya stronger, one donation at a time.
