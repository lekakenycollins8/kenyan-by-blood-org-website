# Kenyan by Blood — A Lifeline Born of Love and Urgency

It began with a question many of us don't often ask ourselves:

**"If someone I love needed blood today—would it be there?"**

In Kenya, every ten minutes, seven people need a blood transfusion. That could be a mother giving birth, a child battling cancer, or a road accident victim clinging to life. But the painful reality is—most of the time, there simply isn't enough blood.

In 2020, as the world reeled from a pandemic and our hospitals struggled with shortages, a group of passionate Kenyans came together with a single, urgent mission: to save lives by changing the culture of blood donation in our country. And so, the Kenyan By Blood Foundation was born—not just as an organization, but as a movement.

We are a registered nonprofit working hand in hand with the Ministry of Health and the Kenya Tissue and Transplant Authority, building a future where every Kenyan, in every county, has timely access to safe blood. We do this through education, mobilization, and by creating strong partnerships across schools, communities, county governments, and healthcare providers.

But our story isn't just told in numbers—it lives in the smiles of mothers who survive childbirth because someone cared enough to donate. It lives in the relief of a family that didn't have to beg strangers online for blood. It lives in every young Kenyan who rolls up their sleeve not for recognition, but because they know they might save someone's life.

We're innovating how blood reaches the people who need it most—with mobile clinics, community rallies, and even drone technology delivering blood across hard-to-reach areas. Since we began, we've helped collect hundreds of thousands of pints and built the backbone of over 42 satellite blood banks across Kenya.

## But we can't do it alone.

Our dream is bold: to collect 1 million pints of blood every year by 2025. With your help, it's possible.

Whether you're an individual, a company, or a global partner—we invite you to walk with us. Every pint donated, every campaign supported, every voice raised helps us build a healthier, more compassionate Kenya.

Because saving lives is not just a medical act—it's a human one. And in this mission, we are all Kenyan by Blood.
