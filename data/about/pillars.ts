      title: "Targeted Education",
      description:
        "The goal of using targeted education is to emphasize the role of every person in voluntarily non-remunerated blood donation, and the necessity of donating blood on a regular basis. Apart from acquiring long term partnerships from the leading institutions, all members of the institutions must be encouraged to donate blood through appealing to their altruism while countering negative stereotypes or misconceptions associated with blood donation. Targeted education is providing us an avenue to address the psychosocial correlates of blood donation motivation depending on the potential donor group in question, e.g. patriotism, empathy, altruism or reciprocity.",
