      "The demand for blood and blood products, and corresponding national dependency on blood transfusion has increased over the years. The SDG progress report of Kenya states that the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) in Kenya was 97 deaths per 100,000.",
    additionalInfo:
      "This ratio differs according to county, with the highest MMR reported in Garissa (249), Mombasa (191), Marsabit (186) and Kisumu (185) while the lowest institutional MMR was in Nyamira (8), Elgeyo Marakwet (27), Machakos (36), Siaya (45) and Kwale (50) counties. 40% of these deaths are caused by obstetric hemorrhage.",

    ],
    conclusion:
      "More than half of the blood donors in 2021 fell between the 16-25 age range. These figures indicate the positive impact of KNBTS strategy of targeting the youthful population in learning institutions. The number of adults who donated blood within the past year, owing to KNBTS's mobilization campaign, indicates that more blood donors could be recruited through consistent engagement.",
