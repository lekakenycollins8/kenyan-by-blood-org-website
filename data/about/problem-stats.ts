    text: "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Kenya has an annual demand of approximately 500,000 units of blood. However, in the FY 2022/2023 ending June the country collected 412,531 units annually, leaving a substantial gap in the supply of safe and adequate blood. The shortage of blood in Kenya is a result of several factors, including inadequate infrastructure, limited funding, and poor blood donor recruitment and retention.",
